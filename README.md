## About Me
- My wife and I are from New Zealand which makes me a Kiwi.
- I studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Canterbury University with a minor in software and computing :computer: which I now do full time in Ōtautahi (Christchurch, :New_Zealand:).
- I enjoy designing full-stack solutions from scratch, most commonly with <img src="https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/raw/master/icons/file_type_csharp2.svg" width="20" alt="csharp"> and <img src="https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/raw/master/icons/file_type_sql.svg" width="20" alt="sql">.
